      <h3>Lessons leanrt from Job's Stanford commencement</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I have learned from Steve Jobs that sometimes you have to do that one 
          thing you've never done in your life and have no clue about. This 
          is shown he tried the  calligraphy class and learned 
          serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of 
          space between different letter combinations, about what makes
           great typography great. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes the decision made by your mates maybe an opening milestone for
          you. Its good to start over because when Jobs was fired from Apple 
          he had no one to lean on and decided to found NeXT which was later bought
          by Apple. So be curious and passionate throughout your life.
        </li>
        <li>
        Stay hungry, stay foolish that we should never stop learning and
         we should always try new things. We should be courageous and 
         never be afraid to go the extra mile. We must have a want, we can
          always build something better. We should not waste time living
           someone elseâ€™s life. We should always trust our guts and intuition.
           They are somehow right.
